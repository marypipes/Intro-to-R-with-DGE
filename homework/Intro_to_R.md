# Practice with R
## Creating vectors/factors and dataframes
6. We are performing RNA-Seq on cancer samples being treated with three different types of treatment (A, B, and P). You have 12 samples total, with 4 replicates per treatment. Write the R code you would use to construct your metadata table as described below.  
Create the vectors/factors for each column (Hint: you can type out each vector/factor, or if you want the process go faster try exploring the rep() function).
Put them together into a dataframe called `meta`.
Use the rownames() function to assign row names to the dataframe (Hint: you can type out the row names as a vector, or if you want the process go faster try exploring the paste() function).
Your finished metadata table should have information for the variables "sex", "stage", "treatment", and "myc" levels: 

| sex	| stage |	treatment	| myc |
| :--:	| :--: |	:---:	| :--: |
sample1	M	I	A	2343
sample2	F	II	A	457
sample3	M	II	A	4593
sample4	F	I	A	9035
sample5	M	II	B	3450
sample6	F	II	B	3524
sample7	M	I	B	958
sample8	F	II	B	1053
sample9	M	II	P	8674
sample10	F	I	P	3424
sample11	M	II	P	463
sample12	F	II	P	5105

 
## Subsetting vectors/factors and dataframes
 7. Using the metadata table from question #6, write out the R code you would use to perform the following operations (questions DO NOT build upon each other):
a. return only the "treatment" and "sex" columns:
b. return the "treatment" values for samples 5, 7, 9, and 10:
c. use subset() to return all data for those samples receiving treatment "P":
d. use subset() to return only the "stage" and "treatment" data for those samples with "myc" > 5000:
e. remove the "treatment" column from the dataset:
f.  remove samples 7, 8 and 9 from the dataset:
g. keep only samples 1-6:
h. add a column called "pre_treatment" to the beginning of the dataframe with the values T, F, F, F, T, T, F, T, F, F, T, T (Hint: use cbind()): 
i. change the names of the columns to: "A", "B", "C", "D":
 
## Lists
8. Create a new list, "list2" with three components, the "glengths" vector, the dataframe "df", and "number" value. Use this list to answer the questions below . "list2" has the following structure (NOTE: the components of this list are not currently named):
[[1]]
[1]   4.6  3000.0 50000.0 
 
[[2]]
     species glengths
1   ecoli       4.6
2   human   3000.0
3   corn       50000.0
 
[[3]]
[1] 8

Write out the R code you would use to perform the following operations (questions DO NOT build upon each other):
a. return the second component of the list:
b. return "50000.0" from the first component of the list:
c. return the value "human" from the second component: 
d. give the components of the list the following names: "genome_lengths", "genomes", "record". Then return "record":
